# Manifest
Leverage latest web based software tools to bridge the gap between monolith, microservice, and serverless. Better yet... don't do it at all - Manifest will do the job for you. Manifest reads your project, isolates services, and generates a modern architecture for you. You can go back to thinking of your code as a single layer - functions. This probably doesn't make sense - it hasn't been done before - so check out [the examples](/examples).
